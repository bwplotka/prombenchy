# prombenchy

This repo contains very simplistic, experimental and opinionated [prombench](https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/prombench) alternative
that focuses on benchmarking (and testing) the collection mode for Prometheus metrics (discovery + scrape + basic processing + remote write) on GKE.

This may or may not end up as the another mode/feature/version of prombench itself, but feel free to use it as you wish. 

### Usage

TBD (:

### Credits

This repo was started by sharing a lot of design and resources from https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra repo, which we maintain in the
Prometheus team mostly for [prombench](https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/prombench) functionality. Kudos to prombench
project for the hard work so far!
